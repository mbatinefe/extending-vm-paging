# Extending a Virtual Memory Implementation with Paging

This project, part of SabancÄ± University's Operating Systems (CS 307) course, involves extending an existing Virtual Memory (VM) implementation. It introduces paging for address translation, multiple processes, and system calls to manage process memory dynamically.

## Introduction
In this project, a simple VM was extended to include:
1. Paging for address translation between Virtual Address Space (VAS) and physical memory.
2. System calls (`yield` and `brk`) for managing context switching and heap allocation.
3. Enhanced support for multiple processes with Process Control Blocks (PCBs).

## Features
- **Paging:** Each process maps virtual addresses to physical frames.
- **Multiple Processes:** Context switching is supported using PCBs.
- **Dynamic Heap Management:** Implemented using the `brk` system call.
- **System Calls:** 
  - `yield`: Switches between processes.
  - `brk`: Allocates or frees heap pages dynamically.
- **Error Handling:** Includes segmentation faults, memory protection errors, and heap allocation errors.

## Implementation Details
### Virtual Address Space (VAS)
- Addressed by 16-bit unsigned integers (`uint16_t`).
- Composed of:
  - Reserved region for the OS.
  - Fixed 8KB code segment (2 pages).
  - Dynamic heap segment (initially 8KB).

### Physical Memory
- Total size: 128KB (32 pages of 4KB each).
- Layout:
  - OS occupies the first 8KB (2 pages).
  - Third page reserved for page tables.
  - Remaining space allocated dynamically for user processes.
- **Page Bitmap:** Tracks free/used pages.

### New Trap Types
- **Yield (`tyld`):** Triggers context switch.
- **Break (`tbrk`):** Allocates or frees memory pages in the heap.

### System Calls
#### `yield`
- Saves current process context to its PCB.
- Switches to the next runnable process.
- Prints: `We are switching from process <oldProcID> to <newProcID>`.

#### `brk`
- Allocates or frees a heap page based on the value in register `R0`.
- Example:
  - Request to allocate: `Heap increase requested by process <curProcID>`.
  - Error (already allocated): `Cannot allocate memory for page <VPN> of pid <CurProcId> since it is already allocated.`

### Key Functions
#### `initOS()`
- Initializes OS memory structures and free page bitmap.

#### `createProc(char *code, char *heap)`
- Creates a new process and allocates its code and heap pages.

#### `allocMem(uint16_t ptbr, uint16_t vpn, uint16_t read, uint16_t write)`
- Allocates a page and updates its Page Table Entry (PTE).

#### `freeMem(uint16_t vpn, uint16_t ptbr)`
- Frees a page and updates the bitmap.

#### `loadProc(uint16_t pid)`
- Loads a process's context from its PCB to the CPU registers.

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Run the VM:
   ```bash
   ./vm code.obj heap.obj
   ```
   To run multiple programs:
   ```bash
   ./vm code1.obj heap1.obj code2.obj heap2.obj
   ```

## Sample Outputs
Sample test cases and expected outputs are included in the `tests/` and `samples/` directories. Use the following commands to verify correctness:
```bash
$ ./tests/initos-test
$ ./samples/sample1.sh > samples/my-sample1-result.txt
$ diff samples/sample1-result.txt samples/sample1-expected.txt
```

## System Requirements
- GCC compiler (version 5.0+)
- Make build system
- 256MB RAM minimum
- Linux/Unix environment (or Windows with WSL)

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
- Segmentation fault: Check page table entries
- Heap allocation fails: Verify free bitmap state
- Context switch error: Ensure PCB integrity
